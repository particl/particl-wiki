## Requirements

There are couple of things needed before you can access the [Particl Open Marketplace](/learn/marketplace/overview):

- **Particl Desktop** client [installed & working](/tutorial/wallets/particl-desktop#installation)
- **[functional (default) wallet](/tutorial/wallets/particl-desktop#creating-a-new-wallet)** within Particl Desktop
- **PART coins** for buying/selling (get some on [available exchanges](https://particl.io/part-exchanges))

Make sure you have a Particl Desktop installed with a working wallet before continuing.


## Create Market-enabled wallet

**To enable the Open Marketplace, you need to [create a second wallet](/tutorial/wallets/particl-desktop#creating-a-new-wallet) and name it `Market`**. Doing so will enable marketplace functionalities. For the moment, you can only create one (1) market-enabled wallet per client.

- To create a new wallet, click  on the `+` button on the top top left corner of the client (left side-bar)
- Click on `Create new wallet`
- **Name your wallet `Market`** – this step is mandatory to enable the marketplace!

Continue with the _Create wallet_ wizard and follow the instructions until the end.


## Syncing SMSG

Let the SMSG network fully sync – just keep Particl Desktop open and it will gather all the SMSG messages gradually over time.

{{< hint info >}}
**[The SMSG network](/learn/market/smsg), not the Particl blockchain, is where the Listings and Marketplace data is stored**.\
The SMSG network takes considerably longer than the blockchain to sync. Give it at least 30 minutes or more to fully sync. There is currently no indicator on the progress of this network's syncing, just be patient.
{{< /hint >}}

To see the Open Marketplace's Listings, open the **Listings** page. Periodically click on the refresh icon at the top right corner of the Listings page to see new listings coming. As the SMSG network syncs, more listings will start appearing.


## Prepare your Marketplace wallet

To use the Particl Open Marketplace, you will need to fund your wallet with coins and **hold Public AND Anon balances**.

- **The Public balance** is used to pay for listing fees, flag items, and vote on proposals.
- **The Anon balance** is used to purchase items and fund escrow smart-contracts.

{{< hint info >}}
To know why some actions require Public balances and others require Anon balances, please refer to the [Learn: Transaction types](/learn/privacy/transaction-types).
{{< /hint >}}

1. Go to the **Receive** page
2. Deposit PART coins on your public address
3. Wait 1 confirmation (~2 minutes) for your funds to be usable.
4. Go to the **Send/Convert** page of the Particl Desktop client
5. Click on the **Convert Public ⇔ Private** tab
6. Select Public in the **Pay from** box and Anon in the **Convert to** box
7. Enter the amount of coins you want to convert into your Anon balance and click on `Make payment`
8. Verify the amount is correct and click on `Confirm & Send`
9. Wait 12 confirmations (~30 minutes) for your Anon balance to be usable
10. Go to the **Overview** page to see your balances
