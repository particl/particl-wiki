This can become a problem when the size of the blockchain becomes too big that most people start connecting on third-party nodes instead of their own. It is also highly impractical to store full nodes on personal computers when they are several GBs or even TBs.\nOne solution currently under development to increase the scalability of the RingCT privacy protocol is Bulletproofs, “a new, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol with very short proofs and without a trusted setup”.\nThis protocol is expected to reduce the RingCT and CT transaction sizes by around 80% and as such, constitute a very important item in our scalability strategy.  Read the full Bulletproofs whitepaper co-authored by Benedikt Bunz, Jonathan Bootle, Dan Boneh, Andrew Poelstra, Pieter Wuille, and Greg Maxwell.\nLightning Network Lightning network for Particl is not yet implemented  The Lightning Network is a decentralized payment channel protocol first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja in their Lightning Network whitepaper and powered using smart-contract functionality in the blockchain to enable instant, near-zero fee payments across a network of participants.\nInstant Payments Lightning-fast blockchain payments without worrying about block confirmation times. Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating a on-blockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured in milliseconds to seconds.\nScalability Capable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network. Capacity blows away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude. Attaching payment per action/click is now possible without custodians.\nLow Cost By transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Lightning Network allows for exceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant micropayments.\nCross-Chain Cross-chain atomic swaps can occur off-chain instantly with heterogeneous blockchain consensus rules. So long as the chains can support the same cryptographic hash function, it is possible to make transactions across blockchains without trust in 3rd party custodians.\nData Storage Network (DSN) Read more about Open Marketplace-related scalability with Data Storage Network (DSN)  "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/learn/blockchain/particl-specifications/','title':"Specifications",'content':"Blockchain          Codebase Always up-to-date with latest Bitcoin Core   Consensus mechanism Particl Proof-of-Stake (PPoS)   Block time 120 seconds (5× faster than BTC)   Block size 2 MB (2× larger than BTC)    Coin supply          Total \u0026amp; circulating supply 9+ million PART (check link for exact number)   Community fund ~33,000 PART (owned by PART community)    Staking          Block reward ~0.66 PART   Coin maturity 225 confirmations (~8 hours)   Yearly interest rate Min. 2% (based on network weight)   Particl Cold Staking Quantum-resistant cold staking with support for hardware wallets    Features          SegWit Native, enabled by default for all transactions   Atomic Swaps Enabled \u0026amp; compatible   Transaction Types Public (pseudonymous, like BTC), Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT (on testnet, in development)   Multi-sig security Supported with Particl Copay   Lightning Network Coming soon   Bulletproofs Enabled (on testnet, in development)    "});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/learn/privacy/transaction-types/','title':"Transaction types",'content':"As the highest privacy state requires the most transaction fee, it may not always be the best type of transaction depending on the situation, especially when privacy is not predominantly required by the user.\n Particl\u0026#39;s multiple privacy states      Public Blind Anon     Staking      Privacy ∗ ∗∗ ∗∗∗   Hidden TX amount      Anon TX participants      TX fees $ $$ $$$       Open Marketplace Public Blind Anon     Paying for Listing fees  – –   Flagging items  – –   Purchasing items – –    Funding MAD Escrow – –     Why has PART different privacy states?\n Freedom of choice To keep the process of coin minting transparent and have a fully auditable supply.

They are the cheapest transactions to execute and is the default privacy setting.\n Blind (CT) This type of transaction uses the Confidential Transactions (CT) privacy protocol developed by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell to keep the transferring amounts visible only to the transaction participants (and those they designate), while still guaranteeing the transaction’s cryptographic integrity.\nThis is a mid-level privacy option and is more expensive than public transactions, but cheaper than anon transactions. Mathematical and cryptographic details related to the CT privacy protocol are available on Maxwell’s original investigation into the protocol.\n Anon (RingCT) This type of transaction uses the RingCT privacy protocol developed by Shen Noether to hide both transferring amounts and participants’ blockchain identity by combining Cryptonote’s ring signatures and Maxwell’s CT protocols. It is the one of the highest level of trustless privacy protocol the crypto industry has to offer and was made famous by Monero.\nIt is also the most expensive privacy setting to use.\nMathematical and cryptographic details related to the RingCT privacy protocol are available on Shen Noether’s RingCT whitepaper.\n  "});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/tutorial/merchants/accepting-part/','title':"Accepting PART for Merchants",'content':"Advantages Accepting Particl (and many other cryptocurrencies) gives you – as a Seller – many advantages over traditional fiat payment systems:\n No chargebacks – all cryptocurrency transactions are final, no chargebacks are possible Complete control – you are the only owner of the private keys to your wallet, no one can freeze your account or shut it down  If further security and financial privacy are important to your and your business, see our Particl Open Marketplace, which was developed with exactly those in mind.

Notes Preparation Compile  Check progress Post-compilation       Notes  This guide is focused on Ubuntu-based distros - on other distributions, you might to install more dependencies etc. (also tweak the commands accordingly) Be patient - the builds can take up to few hours (about 3-4 hrs on systems we tested on) - luckily you can still use your PC for other things in the meantime For PGP signing of Gitian builds  make sure the PGP key you\u0026rsquo;re using is not protected by a passphrase - if it is, signing will fail you\u0026rsquo;ll need to submit a PR to particl-core/contrib/gitian-keys with your PGP key, so that others can verify your signatures    Preparation All these instructions in this \u0026ldquo;Preparation\u0026rdquo; section need to be run only once per machine. After you have it all set up (and perhaps want to compile the next version), just skip ahead to \u0026ldquo;Compile\u0026rdquo; section.  Before we begin, we should make sure that lxc-start and execute and use sudo without a password (otherwise you\u0026rsquo;ll need to enter your root password few times during the compilation, which would further prolong the whole process):\nsudo -s echo \u0026#34;%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/lxc-start\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/sudoers.d/gitian-lxc echo \u0026#34;%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/lxc-execute\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/sudoers.d/gitian-lxc Install dependencies:\n$ sudo apt-get install git curl wget Grab the latest Particl Core code and gitian-builder from Github:\n$ mkdir ~/gitian $ cd ~/gitian $ git clone https://github.com/particl/particl-core.git $ cp particl-core/contrib/gitian-build.py . $ git clone https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder.git We need to add some extra space to our lxc image:\n$ sed -i -- \u0026#39;s^10240^16000^g\u0026#39; gitian-builder/bin/make-base-vm $ sed -i -- \u0026#39;s^12287^16000^g\u0026#39; gitian-builder/bin/make-base-vm Get the macOS SDK for the ability to compile macOS builds as well:\n$ mkdir gitian-builder/inputs $ cd gitian-builder/inputs $ wget https://bitcoincore.org/depends-sources/sdks/MacOSX10.11.sdk.tar.gz $ cd ~/gitian At this point, you\u0026rsquo;ll need your PGP key. As mentioned in the Notes above, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a key without a passphrase. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have one, generate a new PGP key now.  In the next step, replace KEYNAME by name of your key.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re not sure about its name, check your PGP keys and locate the one you want to use (in this example, the name is represented as KEYNAME):\n$ gpg --list-secret-keys /home/user/.gnupg/pubring.kbx ------------------------------- sec rsa4096 XXXX-XX-XX [SCA] [expires: XXXX-XX-XX] XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX uid [ultimate] KEYNAME \u0026lt;email@example.com\u0026gt; ssb rsa4096 XXXX-XX-XX [E] [expires: XXXX-XX-XX]   Prepare the build process (replace KEYNAME by the key\u0026rsquo;s name and VERSION by latest Particl Core version):\n$ ./gitian-build.py --setup KEYNAME VERSION # for example: $ ./gitian-build.py --setup allienworks 0.18.1.3 $ cd ~/gitian Check ifconfig - if you see a lxcbr0 interface, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to rename it to br0. If you can locate br0 right away, you\u0026rsquo;re all good and can skip this step:\n$ ifconfig # if you see lxcbr0, then: $ sudo sed -i s/lxcbr0/br0/ /etc/default/lxc-net Congratulations, that concludes all the one-time preparations. Onwards to compilation!\nCompile Once you did the Preparation part of this guide, all you need to do from that point on is the compilation. Even with new releases in the future, you just need to run this compile command, nothing else.  Running the build accepts quite a lot of parameters:\n again replace KEYNAME by name of your key replace VERSION by the version you want to compile -j - number of threads used for compilation (e.g. if you have 8 threads on your CPU, you can safely use -j 7) -m - allocated memory in MB (e.g. allocate 10 GB by -m 10000)  $ /usr/bin/time ./gitian-build.py --no-commit -j 5 -m 5000 -b KEYNAME VERSION # for example: $ /usr/bin/time ./gitian-build.py --no-commit -j 5 -m 5000 -b allienworks 0.18.1.3 Check progress Once you hit Enter, the compilation will begin. You can check its status by running:\n$ tail -f ~/gitian/gitian-builder/var/install.log # and then $ tail -f ~/gitian/gitian-builder/var/build.log Linux builds will be first, followed by Windows and then macOS. Linux takes the most time (about half of the whole compilation process), so be patient.\nPost-compilation After couple hours, when the compilations is done, you can find a new folder ~/gitian/particl-binaries/\u0026lt;VERSION\u0026gt; with all the builds in it.\nIf the PGP signing was successfull, you should see signatures of the builds signed by your PGP key in ~/gitian/gitian.sigs/\u0026lt;VERSION\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;ARCH\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;KEYNAME\u0026gt;/.

Particl Core Particl Desktop Particl Market       What is PART? It’s a technically advanced privacy coin, a voting ticket, a moderation token, a source of passive income, and much more. It is multi-purpose.\nCan I store PART on a hardware wallet? Yes, PART is officially supported by Ledger wallet with cold staking capabilities enabled. You can set up your hardware Particl wallet and start safely earning staking rewards.\nParticl is also currently working on a Trezor integration.\nWhere can I buy PART coins? You can buy PART coins on these exchanges\nWill PART be added to other exchanges? The Particl team is in constant discussion with many exchanges, however, the decision to list PART or not is entirely up to the exchanges themselves.\nWhat is PART\u0026rsquo;s codebase? PART is built on the Bitcoin Core codebase and is always kept up-to-date with Bitcoin\u0026rsquo;s latest version within days. Updating the codebase to the most recent version allows the platform to benefit from the latest security, performance and stability development made on the Bitcoin Core codebase as well as stay compatible and easy to integrate with the ever-evolving Bitcoin ecosystem.\nWhat are the transactions fees for PART? The default fee for public transactions is 0.002 PART per kb but you can adjust the limit to your needs (higher fee = better confirmation times).\nPrivacy transactions (RingCT + Bulletproofs) default to around 0.005 PART per transaction, although that fee varies depending on the number of ring signatures (degree of privacy) used by the user when making a transaction.\nWhat are PART\u0026rsquo;s transactions sizes?

To raise the probability and lower the technical barrier to get adopted by third-party services (easier to integrate). As fees are higher for privacy transactions, some users might not want to execute private transactions if they do not require it.  Are whitepapers available for the CT and RingCT privacy protocols? While there is currently no whitepaper available as it relates to our own integration onto the Bitcoin Core codebase, there are whitepapers available for the original privacy protocols themselves:\n Confidential Transactions (CT) RingCT  Is Segwit enabled? Particl is natively integrated with Segwit, meaning it has been activated since Block 1 and is enabled by default on all transactions. It is not possible to make non-Segwit transactions on Particl.\nWhat are atomic swaps? Atomic swaps are decentralized and trustless trade between two users of different cryptocurrencies. It makes trading cryptocurrencies without any third-party (i.e. trading exchange) and have blockchains directly interact between each other (i.e. cross-chain smart-contracts) possible.\nWhat is Particl\u0026rsquo;s transaction-per-second (TPS) capabilities? Calculating this metric is pretty hard as greatly depends on the ratio of public, blinded and anonymous transactions. Several other factors can impact the results such as smart-contracts and multisig address transactions.\nIn the end, a more accurate metric would be to calculate each transaction size. Regardless, it is still possible to calculate a very approximative estimate of Particl\u0026rsquo;s TPS by assuming all transactions are either public or private, and by disregarding smart-contracts and multi-signatures. In reality, this metric is pretty innacurate, but interesting nonetheless if only to observe the purely coin-related theoretical performance of the blockchain:\n    Bitcoin Particl     Block Size 1 MB 2 MB   Block Time 10 min 2 min   TPS (100% public transactions) ~7 (no Segwit) ~85 (Default Segwit)   TPS (100% RingCT transactions) - ~8.80 (Default Segwit + Bulletproofs)    (The ring signature is calculated with 4 ring members)\nWhere can the debug logs be found?

You can check lock state by moving your mouse over the Lock icon in the bottom corner of your client. If your client is locked, click the icon and enter your password (you chose this password when you encrypted your wallet). You have mature coins. However weird that may sound, your coins need to mature first. When you withdraw coins from exchanges or receives them from friends, buyers, or from the escrow deal after a successful marketplace transaction, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to wait at least 8 hours (225 confirmations) for them to mature. Only then they will stake. Keep in mind that first staking may be a bit longer than that – wait at least one day till you\u0026rsquo;ll be getting regular staking rewards. You have some public PART coins. As described in the comparison of currency types, Anonymous and Blind PART coins don\u0026rsquo;t stake. If you want stake rewards, be sure to have some public PART coins. Have a decent amount of coins. If you have less than ~1000 PART, you won\u0026rsquo;t see staking rewards too often. Higher amounts of PART stake statistically more often. Your wallet is open ideally 24/7. Staking doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a lot of electricity (as mining in PoW), but it needs some time. If your client is open just few hours a day, you might not see many staking rewards. For ideal results, keep you client open and staking 24/7. Dedicated staking devices (like Raspberry Pi or Pine64) are great way to achieve that without the need of having your main computer running all night. You\u0026rsquo;re in sync with the network. This may be obvious, but you won\u0026rsquo;t get any rewards during the time you sync your client with the network.

It operates with no central authority or middleman and is exclusively owned and operated by its network of participants. Its decentralized nature enables new opportunities that cannot be offered by any other marketplace.\nThe Open Marketplace focuses on four core values: privacy, security, scalability, and absolute decentralization. It attains this goal by leveraging a combination of many different protocols. Each of these protocols contribute to Particl\u0026rsquo;s core values in their own way.\nTo access Particl Open Marketplace\nfollow our Getting started with Open Marketplace guide!  Features  Open Marketplace infographic   The Open Marketplace is private by default.\n This means it automatically keeps users' identities and data private without requiring any extra step from the user. The only exception to that rule is the Tor setup which isn\u0026rsquo;t enabled by default for security measures.\nThe Particl team is committed to only use the best privacy protocols the industry offers. It also constantly research, develop, and maintain the solutions deployed in the marketplace. As absolute privacy and security is the modus operandi of the project, it supersedes anything else. This means there is no concession made that would weaken the privacy setup of the marketplace in favor of something else.\nPayments  All payments and transactions made on the Open Marketplace are untraceable by default.\n This is achieved by leveraging the Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT capabilities of the Particl coin (PART). These two protocols are integrated as the default types of payments, as specified by the OMP.\nCT and RingCT transactions have been historically used on the Cryptonote codebase. Yet, the Particl team has adapted these protocols to be compatible with the Bitcoin codebase, which is the codebase used for the PART coin. The Bitcoin codebase gives more flexibility, security, and stability to the PART coin that the Cryptonote codebase would. A good example for this is the ability for the RingCT and CT protocols to interact with smart-contracts (i.e. the Open Marketplace). The coin also uses the Bulletproofs CT protocol improvement (currently on testnet) which reduces range proofs by about 70%. This ensures marketplace payments are both anonymous and scalable at the same time.\nListings Public listings on Particl\u0026rsquo;s Open Marketplace are listings that are publicly available. Anyone can search for these listings using keywords and by navigating to the correct categories. Although these listings are public, they still offer a great level of privacy as all transactions are untraceable by default.\nThe only “identifiable” data public listings reveal is a unique and anonymous vendor ID. This ID cannot, however, link to any payment address or traceable identity.\nParticl Open Marketplace also offers Private listings on users' \u0026ldquo;private markets\u0026rdquo;, called Private Bubbles  No metadata  The Open Marketplace does not generate any sort of traceable data.\n That much is true whether you are a buyer or a vendor. Metadata is “data about data” and can be very useful to track users. For example, pictures usually carry data such as the device used to take the picture, when it was taken, and even the precise geo-location of where the picture was taken. Any data stored off-chain on Particl\u0026rsquo;s network is immediately stripped of all its metadata, making it impossible to trace people using metadata. This behavior is enabled by Particl\u0026rsquo;s SMSG Data Storage Network.\nIP address anonymization IP addresses can easily be anonymized on the Open Marketplace by installing Tor and editing the configuration file of your Particl Desktop client. Doing so shields you from getting your real IP address to be broadcast to the network.\nParticl Desktop currently doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically route connections through Tor for security measures. If that were the case, a new Particl Desktop version would need to be installed by the user every time Tor pushes a new update. Automatic Tor updates, on the other hand, introduce severe security vulnerabilities, especially in regards to the authenticity of the files being automatically pushed to the client.\nThe Particl team is aware of a few solutions to circumvent this issue. It is also looking into alternatives to Tor. Automatic IP address anonymization should make their way onto Particl Desktop in the future.\n"});index.add({'id':18,'href':'/tutorial/privacy/tor/','title':"Particl with Tor",'content':"    a) Using the Tor Browser b) Using the Tor Daemon c) Tor as a Hidden Service     The only privacy protocol that’s not enabled by default on Particl Desktop is the ability to hide your IP address using the Tor network.\nWhile it could eventually be enabled by default or through the Settings page, Tor currently needs to be activated manually to route your Particl Desktop connection through its network. Don’t worry, it’s not complicated at all and will only take you a few minutes.\nThere are currently 3 ways of using Particl Desktop through Tor network. Choose the one that fits you best:\na) Using the Tor Browser The easiest way to enable the Tor network on Particl Desktop is probably by using the same connection being used by the Tor Browser. To do that, follow these steps:\n Download, install and launch the Tor Browser Connect to the Tor network by clicking on Connect or configure your connection parameters by clicking on Configure Once connected, leave the Tor Browser running in the background Open a terminal and go to the folder you’ve installed your Particl Desktop executable file Launch Particl Desktop with the -proxy=127.0.0.1:9150 argument     OS (package) Launch parameter     Windows “Particl Desktop.exe” -proxy=127.0.0.1:9150   MacOS ./Particl\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop -proxy=127.0.0.1:9150   Linux ./Particl\\ Desktop -proxy=127.0.0.1:9150   Linux (DEB) particl-desktop -proxy=127.0.0.1:9150    b) Using the Tor Daemon The Tor Browser method is quite easy, but if you don’t want to run the Tor Browser alongside Particl Desktop, you can only run the Tor daemon instead. This Tor daemon will run seamlessly in the background and won’t bother you with a browser that you need to keep open.\nWindows  Windows  Download and install the Tor Browser Open the Windows File Explorer and navigate to the directory in which you’ve installed the Tor Browser (i.e. C:\\Tor Browser\\) Go into the Browser\\TorBrowser\\Tor directory Hold down the Shift key and right-click on the Tor folder → Open command window here In the terminal that pops up, type tor.exe –service install Tor should now be running as a Windows service. To verify, hold down the {{fa\u0026gt;windows}} key and press R key to open up the Run window. Then, type services.msc and then press OK You should see Tor running as a service somewhere in the list Go to the folder where your Particl Desktop executable is located Hold down the Shift key and right-click on the Tor folder → Open command window here Launch Particl Desktop and route its connection through Tor by typing “Particl Desktop.exe” -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050   macOS  macOS  Open a terminal Install Brew by typing /usr/bin/ruby -e \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\u0026quot; Go through the installation process Install the Tor daemon: brew install tor Enable Tor as a Brew service: brew services start tor Navigate (using cd) to the folder where your Particl Desktop application icon is located (i.e. cd /home/USER/Applications/) Launch Particl Desktop by routing its connection through the Tor network: ./Particl\\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Particl\\ Desktop -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050   Linux  Linux  Open a terminal Install the Tor daemon: sudo apt install tor (for Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions) Make sure Tor launches on startup: sudo systemctl enable tor Navigate (using cd) to the folder where your Particl Desktop application icon is located (i.e. cd ~/Particl/) Launch Particl Desktop by routing its connection through the Tor network: ./Particl\\ Desktop -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 (if you’ve installed Particl using the DEB package, then simply type this command: particl-desktop -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 from any folder)    c) Tor as a Hidden Service You can also run Tor as a hidden service and connect your Particl Desktop to it. By running Tor as a hidden service, you allow other Tor users to use your node as an entry or exit point. This helps the Tor network being more decentralized, thus increasing its anonymity.\nPlease refer to dedicated guide on running Tor as Hidden Service  "});index.add({'id':19,'href':'/learn/misc/proposals/','title':"Proposals",'content':"    What can you vote on?

A confirmation window should now appear. Ensure that the information is correct, and then click on Send You can confirm that cold staking has been successfully activated by going in the Coins page once again. You should see a new output represented by a 256bit address that should be equal to the sum of the value of the outputs you\u0026rsquo;ve selected for staking, minus the change and network fees You can further confirm that the staking pool has detected it by copying this new 256-bit address in your keyboard and going to the following link: https://IP_ADDRESS_OR_URL_OF_THE_POOL/api/json/address/YOUR_256_BIT_ADDRESS_HERE. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of how it may look with the proper information added: https://coldstakingpool.com/api/json/address/2voNrBmH275emiEX95na1eFBJemWg9fkDPJLIJxxWdR9c6Qi7x6. If your outputs have been detected by the pool, your browser should display the correct number of satoshis currently cold staking in the pool Once that output matures (255 blocks), any stakes made by the pool will accumulate in that address in proportion to your balance relative to the total amount of coins staking in the pool Note that if you move that output (256-bit address), the spending address will change and will start accumulating from zero again If you want to increase your privacy while staking, you can indicate to Particl Electrum a list of change addresses in the Tools/Preferences/ColdStaking menu.

The blockchain has finished syncing, but there are no listings on the marketplace I’ve downloaded and installed Particl Desktop 2.0+, but I do not see the marketplace I’ve converted some funds from my public balance to my anon balance, but I still cannot buy anything on the marketplace     Are there fees for using the marketplace?  For buyers: None (0%) For using the decentralize escrow system: None (0%) For vendors: Only a small, one-time listing fee designed to fight off spammers. The cost of the fee is dynamically adjusted depending on the listing size (i.e. amount of text, listing images size and number, etc) and is also dependent on the amount of days it stays listed as chosen by the vendor himself. The decentralized MAD escrow mechanism also does not require any fee except for the usual currency transaction fee.  Who collects the fees? All of the fees generated by the Open Marketplace are redistributed, in its entirety, to the coin holders actively staking their coins (stakers). Not only do stakers earn all of the fees generated by the marketplace, but also all the fees generated by the Particl platform (i.e. transaction or proposal fees) as well as their staking rewards.\nDo I need to keep my computer online for my listings to stay up? No, once you have paid your listing fee, your listing will stay for as long as you\u0026rsquo;ve paid for.\nHow long do listings stay up? Vendors can manually select the amount of time they would like their listings to stay on when creating them. Currently, the maximum amount of time is set at 7 days (1 week).\nCan I use any other coin other than PART? Not for the Beta version, but it is a feature that is planned for future releases.\nAn eCommerce platform built focused on the free market should not be limited by its own built-in currency. Our mission is to lower the barriers to entry into the cryptocurrency economy as well as reduce friction in decentralized shopping and online shopping in general.\nFor this reason, and in the spirit of connecting many different cryptocurrency communities together, Particl\u0026rsquo;s Open Marketplace is going to be designed in such a way that it can accept a wide variety of coins using either atomic swaps or third-party integrations (i.e. Changelly).\nAs the marketplace requires PART to function (MAD escrow, privacy capabilities etc.), all incoming non-PART transactions are automatically converted into PART in the background.  Are regular (fiat) currencies and traditional means of payment accepted? Not for the Beta version, but it is a feature that may come in future releases. The integration of this particular feature will be dependent on if a solution that does not infringe on Particl\u0026rsquo;s mission and vision (security and privacy) can be found and integrated into a user-friendly way.\nHow much privacy does the marketplace offer? The Open Marketplace is built from the ground up as a privacy and security focused platform. All of the features and integrations developed for the Open Marketplace are designed in such a way that it won\u0026rsquo;t leak any information about the platform\u0026rsquo;s users. Personal/business data and privacy are protected as various levels:\n Marketplace transactions: Purchases and sales made on the marketplace are all private by default. All transactions are made using a combination of both CT and RingCT privacy protocols. Communications: Communications are not currently integrated into the Open Marketplace, but when they will be, they will all be encrypted and secure by default. Particl uses the SMSG protocol to securely and privately relay messages between nodes. Network identity (IP address): Although this feature is currently not enabled by default (for security reasons), The Open Marketplace can be easily routed to exclusively function over the Tor network. The Particl team is also making research and development into alternative IP anonymization protocols. Metadata: All content uploaded on the marketplace (i.e. listing picture) is completely stripped of all its metadata before being relayed over the Particl network. This protects users from unknowingly leaking personal data over the network by adopting an aggressive stance on metadata stripping. Content upload: All content uploaded on the marketplace (i.e. listing picture) is encrypted and cannot be traced back to the uploader. Escrow: The Open Marketplace\u0026rsquo;s decentralized escrow system works without the intervention of any intermediary. This means that no other party other than you and the one you are making a transaction with has to read previous discussions to make a decision on an issue. This ensures both parties can carry on business in perfect confidentiality.  Is the marketplace moderated?  What will stop illegal listings from appearing on the marketplace?\n The Open Marketplace is moderated by its community through a decentralized governance mechanism based on coin weight. To delete content off of the marketplace, users need to flag it enough times so that its flagging ratio goes over the determined ratio (which currently stands at 10% of all coins in circulation voting against). No member of the Particl team can censor or delete any content.\nHow does the escrow system functions? Particl uses a fully decentralized escrow smart-contract based on the Mutually Assured Destruction game-theory. It uses the BIP 65 opcode to lock funds in a secure multi-signature address until all of the parties (the buyer and the seller) sign off on the transaction.\nBoth parties initiate the escrow transaction by depositing an equal security deposit to symbolize a virtual handshake. This security deposit can be adjusted, if both parties agree, between 0 and 100 percent of the item’s purchase price, but optimal MAD odds are achieved when the insurance deposit equals 100 percent of the item’s purchase price. The buyer also includes in that same transaction the payment for the product being purchased.\nThe funds then stay in this escrow smart-contract and are not released to any party until both confirm that the transaction has been completed satisfactorily. Only after both parties confirm the release of the funds will the vendor receive his payment for his sale. Both parties also get refunded their security deposit in full, at no fee.\nTo avoid filibustering, the MAD smart-contract has a timer that runs for a pre-determined duration of time (which can be extended if both parties agree). Once the timer expires, the funds cannot be released anymore, making the transaction a net loss for both parties. This prevents willingly delaying and hindering the escrow process to game the system by introducing financially punitive measures.\nWhat is the fee for using the escrow system? Barely any. The MAD escrow mechanism in itself is free of charge, but there is still a regular cryptocurrency transaction fee that needs to be paid. This fee is currently fixed at 0.005 PART (pennies) per escrow transaction.\nHow is marketplace data hosted?  How does the marketplace deals with scalability issues? How are messages delivered between users?\n SMSG, the protocol used to carry messages across the network, is the same network used by the Particl platform to store data.\nSMSG is a decentralized P2P message mixnet where all nodes store a copy of everyone\u0026rsquo;s end-to-end encrypted messages and data for a duration of 48 hours (which can be increased for a fee). It is the default and [most private DSN](learn:market:data-storage-network] available for use on the platform. The reference implementation is developed in C++ and incorporated into the Particl daemon, allowing it to operate over the same peer to peer network as the Particl blockchain.\nAll nodes continuously attempt to decrypt every incoming message, but can only succeed if the node is able to recalculate the HMAC hash accompanying said message. If the hash check fails, then it can not be decrypted by the node, which means the message was either fraudulent, tampered with or meant for another node. SMSG messages and data are stripped from almost any metadata, therefore it is impossible for anyone to extract information such as IP addresses, sender or receiver. The only metadata accompanying data on SMSG are the hash, the encryption payload and a temporary public key.\nIs the marketplace available on mobile? Not for the Beta version, but it is a feature that is planned for future releases.\nCan the marketplace be accessed from the web? Not for the Beta version, but it is a feature that is planned for future releases. However, there already is a team of community members working on a web gateway (mubiz.com). This website will make Particl\u0026rsquo;s Open Marketplace available from the web and will allow buyers to use a wide-range of tools designed to make the marketplace as easy to use as any other traditional marketplace. For more information about Mubiz, we recommend reading Cryptoguard\u0026rsquo;s interview with their founder, Albin Cauderlier, on our blog.\nWhy is the marketplace not connecting to any peer? There are many reasons why your instance of the marketplace may not be connecting with any peers. Usually, it has to do with either your firewall, your ISP blocking certain ports, or conflicts with files. The best way to figure it out is to check Support: Connection issues and/or join the #help channel.\nWhy is the marketplace not showing any product? First, make sure that you are properly connected to peers.\nThis should be displayed in the top right corner of your Particl Desktop. If you are properly connected to the network, then you may simply need to wait before the application syncs with the entire network. When syncing the marketplace, not only does the blockchain needs to be on the latest block, but the SMSG network (which carries listings) needs to be fully synced as well. This can sometimes take a bit longer than the blockchain itself. If you are connected and both networks are fully synced but listings are still not showing up, then you may want to do a clean installation of the marketplace to eliminate any issue related to the initial installation.\nWhy is a big portion of my anon balance getting locked after bidding on an item? Bidding on an item requires entire “outputs” to be used. And because of how RingCT works, an output needs to mature for a period averaging 12 blocks after being used. Depending on how your outputs are structured, that may mean a larger number of coins than the price of an item may get locked for a short period of time. To better understand this behavior, let’s analyze three potential scenarios.\n Scenario 1  Number of coins in anon balance: 1,000 Total number of outputs in anon balance: 1 Size of the output(s): 1,000 coins Price of item: 10 PART In that scenario, there is only 1 output that can be used to bid on the item. That means the entire output is going to be locked for a period averaging 12 blocks. In other words, bidding on this 10 PART item will lock 1,000 PART for roughly 30 minutes.   Scenario 2  Number of coins in anon balance: 1,000 Total number of outputs in anon balance: 2 Size of the output(s): 500 coins each (for a total of 1,000 coins since there are two outputs) Price of item: 10 PART In that scenario, 2 outputs can be used to bid on the item. But since the item is valued at 10 PART, it won’t require two outputs to be used as that sum can be covered by only one output. That means only one of the two outputs will have its full number of coins locked away for a period averaging 12 blocks. In other words, bidding on this 10 PART item will lock 500 PART for roughly 30 minutes.   Scenario 3  Number of coins in anon balance: 1,000 Total number of outputs in anon balance: 10 Size of the output(s): 100 coins each (for a total of 1,000 coins since there are ten outputs) Price of item: 150 PART In that scenario, 10 outputs can be used to bid on the item. But since the item is valued at 150 PART, more than one output will be required to cover the price of the item (as every output is 100 PART which is less than the value of the item). That means two of the outputs will have their full number of coins locked away for a period averaging 12 blocks. In other words, bidding on this 150 PART item will lock 200 PART (2 x 100 PART outputs) for roughly 30 minutes.    The more technical explanation is that spendable funds are basically a sum of the amounts available in unspent transactions. When needing to spend a specific amount, one or more of the wallet\u0026rsquo;s unspent transactions (UTXOs) are used as inputs into the transaction, where the sum of the amount of the UTXOs used is greater than or equal to that of the requested specific amount. The transaction itself sends funds to the target recipient, with any change going to another address, typically being returned as a new UTXO in the wallet (if not specified, the change is is consumed as part of the mining fee).\nBecause the inputs used for an escrow transaction need to match exactly the transaction amount the user must spend, a single UTXO that matches that exact amount needs to be found. Failing that (which is typically the case), a number of UTXOs (or a single large enough UTXO) needs to be used as input to a transaction to create a split: 1 amount being the required escrow amount, the other being the change. The first UTXO created is then used as input to the escrow transaction, and the 2nd is returned as change to the wallet. Now the transactions need to wait for the appropriate confirmations to mature.\nHow long do coins stay locked after bidding an item? There are 2 scenarios playing out when performing the bid action:\n Obtaining a single or more UTXO(s) to match the amount that will be used as input into the escrow transaction (the value of the item). There\u0026rsquo;s a second UTXO that gets generated from this step, which is the change UTXO, or the amount that’s over the listed price of the item you’re purchasing. Sending that exact amount UTXO to the seller to be used as part of the signing process for the escrow transaction.  The change UTXO from step 1 matures after the 12 blocks, or roughly 30 minutes. That gets unlocked and is available for spending again once it is matured. However, the UTXO used for step 2 actually remains locked as it needs to be used by the escrow system.\nSimilarly, the same concept applies when the seller accepts a bid: the same 2 steps mentioned above happen with regards to UTXOs getting locked.\nWhat’s the “delisting” threshold? The “delisting” threshold is the number of coins that needs to be voted against a listing before it gets deleted. That threshold is currently set at -9,000.\nParticl’s decentralized moderation system can be compared to the Reddit upvote/downvote system. On Reddit, if 5 users downvote a post, and 3 users upvote it, the post has a score of -2. Usually, when it reaches a certain negative threshold (i.e. -10), the post is automatically hidden from other users. Reddit counts votes on a 1 user = 1 vote basis.\nParticl’s listing moderation system is similar. Each user that flags and votes for a listing contributes to either increasing or decreasing the listing’s score. Flagging a listing also deletes it from the user’s personal instance of the client (hidden locally, but not globally until the listing reaches the delisting threshold). But because Particl is private by design and entirely decentralized, there is no real way for the platform to detect a user that created multiple addresses or used virtual machines to game the system and register fraudulent votes. The network cannot ban an account, blacklist an IP address, or manually adjust votes to try to fight off spam votes. Instead, Particl counts votes on a 1 coin = 1 vote, which makes it impossible to game the system.\nSince the decentralized moderation mechanism is based on coin weight, will moving coins around affect my weight AFTER voting for a listing? Yes. If you increase or decrease your public balance after flagging a listing, your weight will change accordingly.\nWhat type of balance is used for the decentralized moderation mechanism? The mechanism uses your public balance to determine your voting weight. That’s because it is impossible for another client/wallet (which is trying to calculate weighting on their local node) to know what another wallet’s blind and anon balances are. Yes, Particl’s private balances (blind \u0026amp; anon) are that much anonymous.\nThe more technical explanation is that to perform a voting weight calculation on your local node to determine whether a vote has reached a threshold or not, your client/wallet needs to re-query the spendable funds in the addresses (UTXOs) that were used to cast votes. That requires knowing the UTXO amounts, and for blind/anon balances, that is impossible by design. If it were possible, it would entirely defeat the purpose of keeping private balances.\nIs there a fee associated with flagging an item? It depends. When a user flags a listing that has never been flagged before, it creates a removal proposal. This proposal costs a very small flagging fee (usually less than 0.01 PART). The second step of the “flagging process”, which is the voting that happens from the same node at the same time, is free. As are the votes that are made on an already flagged item by other users.\nThe short answer is that if you’re flagging an item that has never been flagged before by anyone else, it’s going to cost you a small flagging fee. If you’re flagging an item that’s already been flagged by another user, then that vote is free.\nWhat type of balance is used to pay listing fees? Fees are paid using your public balance.\nSince listing fees are paid using public balances, does it mean listed items can be traced back to the originator? No. Listing an item is a 0 value transaction, except for the fee paid to send a paid SMSG message. The content of the message is encrypted and only a wallet with the relevant key enabled on the SMSG network would be able to know what the content is.\nThe blockchain has finished syncing, but there are no listings on the marketplace Listings are not published on the blockchain itself, but on a parallel P2P network called SMSG. The SMSG network takes a longer time to fully sync than the blockchain, and it syncs linearly, just like the blockchain. That means it has to sync from day 1 to the present day, hence why you will see listings gradually showing up on your client. Additionally, once the SMSG messages are received by the client/wallet, the marketplace itself needs to process them to generate and display any listings available within them. What you have to do is to wait until the SMSG network is fully synced and refresh the listings page to check for updated listings every now and then.\nI’ve downloaded and installed Particl Desktop 2.0+, but I do not see the marketplace Once you first install Particl Desktop 2.0+, you need to create your first wallet. Not seeing the marketplace on there is the expected behavior.\nTo enable the marketplace, create a new wallet (by clicking on the small + icon on the left side-bar) and name it “Market” (without the quotation marks). Then, go through the usual wallet creation process. Once your wallet is done, you will now see a Market category on Particl Desktop. Keep in mind the marketplace database will then need to be synced, which could take several minutes. In future iterations of Particl Desktop, this process will be made simpler as it will likely be integrated right into a Settings page.\nI’ve converted some funds from my public balance to my anon balance, but I still cannot buy anything on the marketplace You need to wait until your anon balance matures. On average, this will take around 12 blocks, or roughly 30 minutes.\n"});index.add({'id':29,'href':'/tutorial/marketplace/buying-selling/','title':"How to Buy/Sell on Open Marketplace",'content':"If you\u0026rsquo;ve already installed the Particl Open Marketplace and have it enabled on your Particl Desktop client, then you\u0026rsquo;re all set and ready to start buying and selling stuff for crypto without giving away your data.\n   Complete Buy flow  Listing stage Bidding stage Order stage Escrow stage Escrow stage, pt.

To add a new one, click on + Add new listing Fill the Listing\u0026rsquo;s details and add pictures. Note that the first picture you add is going to be used as the thumbnail for your Listing Click on Save \u0026amp; Publish and then type your encryption password to temporarily unlock your wallet. An unlocked wallet is required to publish Listings Choose the duration of the Listing and click on Confirm \u0026amp; Publish – e.g. if you choose 1 week, then your Listing is going to stay up on the Open Marketplace for 7 days Wait for at least one confirmation and your Listing will appear in the Listings page of the Particl Open Marketplace  Listing fees are calculated based on the duration and size of your Listing.\nIn other words, the longer it stays up, and the more images/text your Listing has, the more expensive listing the item will be.  Bidding stage The Buyer places a bid on item\nDuring this step, the Buyer is going to place a bid (an order) and \u0026ldquo;soft lock\u0026rdquo; twice the amount of the item being purchased (including shipping costs). Placing a bid will most probably use more than twice the value of the purchased item, but the extra funds will be refunded after ~30 minutes. To know why, checkout FAQ: Why is a big portion of my Anon balance getting locked after bidding on an item?\n Go to the Listings page Browse the Marketplace, and click on the item you want to purchase On the Listing\u0026rsquo;s pop-up page, verify the total amount required to fund the escrow and then add the item to your cart by clicking on Add to cart To checkout, click on the cart icon at the top right section of the Particl Desktop client or by going to the Buy page Verify the content of your cart, and click on Continue to shipping Fill your shipping information and, optionally, save your shipping profile for future purchases (this profile stays only on your computer) Verify all the information is correct on the next page, and then click on Place order to place your bid Confirm you want to place the order by clicking on Yes, place order on the pop-up confirmation page that appears You can now see the status of your order by clicking on the Orders tab of the Buy page  Order stage The Seller accepts/rejects Buyer\u0026rsquo;s bid\n If the seller rejects the bid, the soft locked funds will release back to you and the Order will be cancelled If the seller accepts the bid, the funds required for the escrow will soft lock on his side as well and the Buy flow continues  To accept/reject incoming bids from Buyers:\n Go to the Sell page and click on the Orders tab Either accept the order by clicking on Yes, accept bid or reject it by clicking on Reject bid \u0026amp; cancel order  Escrow stage The Buyer makes payment into Escrow smart-contract\n Go to the Buy page and click on the Orders tab to see your order Click on the Make payment button to fund the escrow smart-contract A pop-up window will appear, allowing you to send the seller contact information which may be useful for international shipping – giving out that information is entirely optional Confirm your payment by clicking on Confirm \u0026amp; Buy  Escrow stage, pt.

Private by design Scalability     About MAD Escrow Marketplaces usually have mechanisms in place to resolve disputes between buyers and vendors. This is a vital part of e-commerce because trusting strangers, especially when money is involved, has never proven to be reliable. As buyers and vendors do not know and trust each other, there has to be protection against one of the party never honoring their end of the trade.\nOne common solution marketplaces and payment processors use is a mutually-trusted third party (in other words, an escrow agent). On decentralized marketplaces, not only does this represents scalability and privacy issues but it also does not offer any protection against collusion between the escrow agent and one of the party.\nParticl\u0026rsquo;s Open Marketplace solves this problem without the need for a third party.\nIt uses what is called MAD escrow smart-contracts. This type of escrow does not cost any fee, is infinitely scalable and private by design.  Game Theory  Particl\u0026#39;s MAD Escrow logo  Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender, thus making their use not an option.\nIt is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy\u0026rsquo;s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.\nParticl’s MAD escrow mechanism replaces the nuclear annihilation deterrence factor of the MAD game theory for a mutual financial loss should one party acts dishonestly.\nHow does it work? Particl uses the BIP 65 opcode, which allows a transaction output to be made unspendable until some point in the future, to enable MAD escrow contracts. It locks funds in a secure multi-signature address until all the parties sign off on the transaction.\nThe seller starts by depositing an amount they want the buyer to match. The deposit can be between 0–100 % of the purchased item’s price.\nHowever, optimal MAD odds are achieved when the security deposit equals 100 % of the item’s price. The buyer then deposits an equal amount plus the price of the item they are buying. This double security deposit symbolizes a virtual handshake between the buyer and the vendor.\nThe escrowed funds are not released to any party until both confirm that the transaction has been completed satisfactorily. To avoid filibustering, the MAD smart-contract has a timer that runs for a pre-determined duration of time. This can be extended if both parties agree. Once it runs out of time, the funds are locked forever. This prevents both parties from willingly delaying and hindering the escrow process.\nWhen both parties are satisfied with the outcome of the transaction, they have to confirm the transaction as complete. The payment is then released to the vendor and the security deposits are refunded to both parties at no fee.\nPrivate by design  Particl’s MAD escrow system renders the marketplace fully fungible. That\u0026rsquo;s because all transactions are untraceable by default.\n In fact, not only is all marketplace content encrypted, but all currency transactions are made untraceable through the use of the RingCT privacy protocol. This technique enhances privacy much more than if CT MAD escrow was optional because it dramatically increases the number of private transactions on the network.\nAnother privacy-enhancing aspect of the MAD escrow mechanism is its lack of third-party acting as escrow agent. In fact, in most centralized escrow system, conversations between the buyer and the seller are available to the escrow agent. This is so the escrow agent can step in if any problem arises and issue a resolution based on the context. This puts a lot of power into the agent\u0026rsquo;s hands and assumes it is acting in an honest way.\nBy not requiring any third-party, the Open Marketplace\u0026rsquo;s escrow system preserves the privacy of both parties. Any transaction detail or conversation is only available to the transacting parties and no one else.\nScalability  This form of decentralized escrow is infinitely scalable. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t need any other party other than the ones transacting to function.\n This means there is no friction whatsoever, and that as many escrow transactions can be opened as required by the users. No staff is required, no data can be mined, and no delay can be caused by outside parties. The Particl network can support an infinite number of escrow deals at the same time.\n"});index.add({'id':32,'href':'/dev/marketplace/','title':"Marketplace",'content':"    "});index.add({'id':33,'href':'/dev/wallets/particl-core/','title':"Particl Core",'content':"Particl Core is a Qt-based wallet with advanced features focused on stability.\n   Compile \u0026amp; Sign Particl Core builds  How to compile own Particl Core builds via Gitian and sign them with PGP     "});index.add({'id':34,'href':'/tutorial/wallets/particl-core/','title':"Particl Core",'content':" Preview of Particl Core  Particl Core is more lightweight than Particl Desktop, offers some advanced features like Coin Control and compatibility with hardware wallets.\nHowever it acts like a wallet only, so you won\u0026rsquo;t have access to Particl Open Marketplace.\n Download Particl Core   Report bugs   Features Browse \u0026amp; compare Particl Core\u0026rsquo;s features with other available wallets.\nGetting started Installation Please note that even though some of these steps are optional/recommended, it is highly advised to follow all of them as it secures your funds from being lost.

In PoS-based cryptocurrencies, the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection of wealth and age. In contrast, the algorithm of Proof-of-Work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e. mining).\nPPoS is built and improved upon the popular PoS3 protocol on top of which were added several security and utility features.\nHow to stake on Particl?\nFollow our guides at Tutorial: How to Stake  Passive Income PPoS can serve as a great passive income tool. It rewards stakers a minmum rate of 5% per year for securing the network, then drops 1% every year until it plateaus at 2%:\n   Period Staking rewards / inflation rate     July 2017 – July 2018 5 %   July 2018 – July 2019 4 %   July 2019 – July 2020 3 %   July 2020 onwards 2 %    This staking reward rate is true if 100% of the total supply is put up for staking, but gets higher as less coins are being staked. For example, if 50% of the total network is being put up for staking, the staking reward rate for the first year would be of 10%.  The Particl platform also redirects any fee generated from it directly to stakers, including but not limited to currency transactions, marketplace listing fees, extended messaging, privacy balance transfers and others, meaning staking becomes more profitable as the platform gets more traffic.\nCold Staking Cold staking is enabled by smart-contract functionality and lets users securely delegate staking powers to “staking nodes” which contain no coin. The purpose of these “staking nodes” is to provide a dedicated resource connected to the Particl blockchain and stake on behalf of another wallet without being able to spend its coins.\nCold staking nodes are intended to be used in combination with cold, hardware and multisig addresses, making it possible to stake “offline” coins with no risk of being hacked or exposing your public key to the network. Staking nodes can be set up on any device, secure or not, such as public/cloud servers, virtual machines or DSDs.\nHow to cold stake on Particl?\nFollow our guide at Tutorial: Cold Staking setup  Cold Hardware Staking It is currently possible to cold stake funds stored offline on a hardware wallet by setting up a Particl wallet on a Ledger hardware wallet.\nWhile cold staking does not store any password in memory and delegates staking powers to empty staking nodes, a cold wallet is still vulnerable when it\u0026rsquo;s interacted with (i.e. when a transaction is executed) from an infected or untrusted computer. Hardware wallets fix this issue by not requiring any exchange of private key between the hardware wallet and the device/computer it is connected to, thus making hardware wallets safe even when they are interacted with from an infected computer.\nCombining cold staking and hardware security effectively makes PPoS the most secure Proof-of-Stake protocol in the industry and fixes several issues generally associated with the Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol in general.  Quantum-resistance \u0026amp; Privacy Current Proof-of-Stake implementations have a vulnerability not present in Proof-of-Work whereby they reveal the public key of staking addresses when they find and sign blocks. The most dangerous attack by quantum computers is against public key cryptography.\nOn traditional computers, it takes on the order of 2128 basic operations to get Bitcoin private keys associated with Bitcoin public keys. This number is so massively large that any attack using traditional computers is completely impractical. However, it is known for sure that it would take a sufficiently large quantum computer on the order of only 1283 basic quantum operations to be able to break a Bitcoin key using Shor’s algorithm. This might take some time, especially since the first quantum computers are likely to be extremely slow, but it is still very practical. It could be estimated that it is maybe 2 to 5 years until quantum computers become an issue, but any project that plans on staying relevant on a long period of time should tackle these vulnerabilities way before they become problematic.\nIt is worth mentioning that public keys are NOT public addresses. To reverse a private key from a public address, it would require more energy than what is available in the universe, therefore a quantum hacker cannot just go pick public addresses with large amounts and reverse those.\nWhen a Particl block is staked from a cold staking node, the private key of the address on the staking node (which contains no coin) is broadcasted to the network instead of the private key of the address which contains the staking funds. Because cold staking nodes are able to sign staked blocks on behalf of any wallet, hot or cold, cold stakers can effectively remain anonymous and shielded from theoretical quantum computer attacks.\n"});index.add({'id':43,'href':'/dev/api/','title':"APIs",'content':"    RPC       Particl Insight  Insight API as a part of Particl Block Explorer     Coingecko  100% free crypto API by CoinGecko     Chainz  Free crypto API by CryptoID\u0026#39;s Chainz     Coinmarketcap  Freemium crypto API by Coinmarketcap     "});index.add({'id':44,'href':'/support/fork/','title':"Chain forks",'content':"If you\u0026rsquo;re experiencing that Particl Desktop or Particl Core wallet is not syncing any further, then it might be because you got caught on a fork due to the latest hardfork.\nIf you execute any transaction during this time, it will appear as if you\u0026rsquo;ve lost the coins, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry. Nothing has left your wallet.\nGetting on the right chain Getting your client back to a working state requires a bit of work.\n1. Update to the latest version of the wallet Updating to the latest version will ensure that you have the latest list of \u0026ldquo;checkpoints\u0026rdquo;. These checkpoints are known blockhashes of the correct chain, which help guide the client guide itself to the right fork.\n2. List all banned nodes and clear them Sometimes the client will ban others nodes for misbehaving. It might be that your client has banned all legitimate nodes because you were on an older version. Open up the debug console and check whether you have any banned peers by listbanned. If that\u0026rsquo;s the case, consider clearing the list by executing clearbanned.\n3. Wait a few minutes Sometimes the client will detect that it has made a mistake and will automatically get itself back on track.\n4. Find out where your client got stuck Open up the debug console in Particl Desktop or Particl Core and execute the following command getchaintips. Look for any chains that are marked invalid. Get the corresponding hash of that chain and execute: reconsiderblock HASH_HERE, where HASH_HERE is value that was returned previously.\n5. Make sure you\u0026rsquo;re fully synced Take a look at the block explorer and verify that your client is syncing to the latest height indicated there. getblockchaininfo will return the height to which you\u0026rsquo;re synced.

All rewards earned while staking from a pool are sent over to the pool operator, which then executes payouts proportional to how much you’ve contributed to the total amount of rewards the pool earned. This is particularly useful if you own fewer coins and still want to stake your coins as it means you’ll earn more frequent, but smaller, staking rewards.\nHow to cold stake on a Pool?\nFollow our guide at Tutorial: Cold Staking setup  The importance of decentralization It is highly recommended to be careful about which cold staking pool you choose to stake your funds with. In fact, because you are effectively delegating your staking power to a third-party, staking from a cold staking pool tends to centralize the staking weight of the network.  In order to be as secure as possible, Proof-of-Stake blockchains need to both have as many coins being staked as possible and as many staking nodes online as possible. The reason behind this is actually similar to Proof of Work\u0026rsquo;s 51% attack where an attacker could get full control over the blockchain if he held more than 50% of all the hashing power (mining power) on the network.\nOn Particl, this attack vector is still possible, although a bit different. For such an exploit to be successful, an attacker, like a malicious pool operator, would need to be in possession of more than 50% of all staking coins. This is the reason you should always be careful not to delegate your staking power to a pool that already holds a considerably high amount of staking weight.\nThe Particl team is not responsible for the management, user support, and debugging of any pool.\nWhile we will offer support for the cold staking pool code itself, we won’t be offering support for any of its implementation made by third-parties; this responsibility should lie within the pool operator himself.

That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.\nFor these reasons, we highly recommend users to protect their funds by setting up a Ledger or other compatible hardware wallet.\nRequirements Before starting the setup process, make sure you have:\n Ledger Nano S/X hardware wallet – initialized and updated to latest firmware Ledger Live app ready to use Particl Core wallet installed and fully synced to the Particl network  Linux users: Make sure you have added the udev rules to allow device access – see Fix connection issues (under Linux tab) for more info. If you already have a working Ledger wallet, you can skip this.  Installation Ledger Particl app First, we need to install Particl on your Ledger device (feel free to follow official Ledger\u0026rsquo;s guide though it\u0026rsquo;s the same):\n open the Manager in Ledger Live connect and unlock your Ledger Nano S if asked, allow the manager on your device by pressing the right button find Particl app in the catalog click the Install button of the app  Note that if you\u0026rsquo;re forced to uninstall Particl app from your Ledger (due to lack of space), you\u0026rsquo;ll have to repeat these steps to access your funds. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, your coins will stay safe even if the app isn\u0026rsquo;t installed in the meantime.\nParticl Core configuration If you already have a Particl wallet on this computer,\nmake sure to back up the wallet.dat file by renaming or moving it elsewhere!          launch Particl Core on your computer go to Window → HD Wallet (if it\u0026rsquo;s the first time you\u0026rsquo;re setting up a wallet on this computer or if you don\u0026rsquo;t have any wallet.dat file in your Particl config folder, then Particl Core will automatically bring you to this dialog) click on the Hardware Device tab connect your Ledger Nano S to your computer via USB make sure the device is properly unlocked (and already initialized via Ledger Live) click on Import when your Particl Core wallet says Waiting for device, follow the instructions displayed on your Ledger hardware wallet screen  Your Particl Core client is now ready to be used in conjunction with your Ledger hardware wallet!\nUsage Sending PART using Ledger         open your Particl Core client containing your Ledger hardware wallet (as set up in the steps above) connect your Ledger hardware wallet to your computer and unlock it using your PIN code select and start the Particl application on your Ledger hardware wallet click on Particl Core\u0026rsquo;s Send tab enter your transaction details (PART amount and destination address) click Send → Yes Particl Core will prompt you to follow the steps displayed on your Ledger hardware wallet\u0026rsquo;s screen – confirm the transaction on your device if the transaction details are correct  Cold staking on Ledger Refer to dedicated how to cold stake on Ledger guide for information about securely cold staking on Ledger wallet.  "});index.add({'id':50,'href':'/learn/marketplace/fees/','title':"Marketplace fees",'content':"Traditional marketplaces usually have pretty complicated or extensive fee schedules. Depending on various variables such as what kind of products you sell, the number of transactions you do, your membership subscription plan, your feedback, and similar sets of data, fees can vary greatly.\nThe total cost associated with selling online usually includes a listing fee, a final value fee (sales fee taken on the value of the item), a subscription fee, a payment processing fee, escrow fee, and more. This is a direct consequence of using third-parties (centralized marketplaces). Every party that contributes to a transaction wants a “piece of the pie” and get paid for the services they offer. This is perfectly normal and expected.\nParticl fees Particl\u0026rsquo;s Open Marketplace has a different approach.\n Because the marketplace is run collectively by its users, there is no operational cost associated with it.\n  Comparison of fee structure across online marketplaces  There is also no company looking into making profits out of its operation. This allows the marketplace to charge the bare minimum for it to operate.\nThe Open Marketplace doesn\u0026rsquo;t charge its buyers with any fee, except for the usual cryptocurrency transaction fee. Its vendors, on the other hand, are only charged with a very small listing fee amounting to only a few cents per item. This is only designed to fight off spam listings and keep the interface clean.\n Particl\u0026rsquo;s fee schedule is unmatched in the e-commerce industry and beats any centralized marketplaces.\n It empowers both vendors and buyers by letting vendors make more profit per sale or by allowing them to reduce their prices to attract more buyers, thus getting bigger sales volume. Vendors make more profits, buyers gain access to cheaper products. This is only possible by using blockchain and P2P technologies.\n"});index.add({'id':51,'href':'/tutorial/security/multisig/','title':"Multi-signature wallets",'content':" This article hasn't been written yet, we're working on it!

Let\u0026rsquo;s now move onto your main wallet and connect it with your Staking Node.\nConnect your wallet To connect your wallet, follow our unified Cold staking setup guide.  Maintenance When your node is successfully set up, here are some tips to keep your node healthy and up-to-date.\nUpdating particld You should always keep your node up-to-date with latest Particl Core releases.\nTo update your node:\n SSH to your device (or connect your monitor) Make sure your system is up-to-date: sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade To update partyman: ~/partyman/partyman update and follow on-screen instructions Wait a couple minutes for particld to restart and check status of your node with ~/partyman/partyman status - look for particld staking currently? : YES  Updating to pre-release versions In case you want to update your particld to pre-release version (ie. betas, not yet stable releases), you can do so by:\ncd ~/partyman/ git pull ./partyman update -prer Updating partyman In case partyman complains about updates available, you can install them simply by going to partyman\u0026rsquo;s directory and getting the latest code from GitHub:\ncd ~/partyman/ git pull "});index.add({'id':59,'href':'/tutorial/privacy/tips/','title':"Tips for increasing privacy",'content':"    Basics Particl  Transactions Balances   Network Other resources     Here are a few tips to keep you private as much as possible:\nBasics  Never brag about how much PART or BTC you own, online or offline. All it does is bringing attention to you; scammers and hackers would surely love to get a piece of your pie. It\u0026rsquo;s not worth the risk. Don\u0026rsquo;t post your crypto addresses publicly – when you get some donations, it will help anybody to track your transactions. If you have to, be sure to post only Private (stealth) addresses or create a completely separated wallet, only for the donations. This way you won\u0026rsquo;t mix up your personal and donations coins.  Particl Transactions  Use unique addresses for each transaction. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you should always change e.g. address for donations you posted on your website, but when transacting with others, it\u0026rsquo;s better to use unique addresses each time. Fortunately, Particl Desktop does generate new receiving address each time. With Particl Core, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to generate them manually. Use Anon transactions whenever possible. Paying a little more for transaction fee makes the whole network a bit more private (everybody profits)  Balances  Grow your \u0026ldquo;pool\u0026rdquo; of Private coins – in other words, keep a portion of your coins in Private balances forever. The more Private coins are in existence, the better for the whole network (regarding privacy). Consider keeping at least 10 % of your funds in Private balances and use those for spending. The rest can stay in Public balance, staking and earning you interest. When receiving Private balances (Blind/Anon) never convert all of them (i.e. exact amount of coins received) back to Public PART immediately. This will make it harder for the bad guys to correlate the links between original Public coins and those you just converted from Private ones.  Network  Use Tor to anonymize your IP and location – visit our dedicated guide on running Tor with Particl  Other resources A great place to learn about all your options for preserving online privacy: PrivacyTools.io  "});index.add({'id':60,'href':'/dev/api/chainz/','title':"Chainz",'content':"Services provided by cryptoid.info are free of charge.\nPlease do not abuse them.

Once the sent coins mature for staking (about 8 hours), they will start staking automatically on your Ledger.\nVerify your setup You can check that your coins are correctly sent to your staking node (or a pool).\nVia Particl Core In Particl Core, go to Staking setup again (Window → Staking Setup) – you should see:\n Cold staking enabled: True Percent in cold staking script: 100.00 (or something really close like 99.81)  Via your staking node If you\u0026rsquo;re self-hosting your staking node, SSH into your device again and in partyman\u0026rsquo;s folder run:\n./partyman status The output of that command should indicate particld staking currently?: YES as well as display the number of coins being staked by the staking node next to particld staking wallet weight: \u0026lt;amount of your coins\u0026gt;\nCongratulations, you\u0026rsquo;re now successfully (and safely!) staking your PART from Ledger hardware wallet!\n"});index.add({'id':63,'href':'/learn/marketplace/governance/','title':"Community governance",'content':"It is instead governed by its community of holders rather than a team of staff or a third-parties.\nDecentralized moderation Since it is fully anonymous, it is not unlikely that undesirable items and services would be listed for sale.

Votes are tallied based on coin weight where one coin equals one vote. The more coins a user holds, the more influence he has over the outcome of a flagging vote.\nOnce a certain weight threshold is reached, the listing is taken out of the marketplace.

Atomic Swaps Third-Party Integrations     What\u0026rsquo;s currency agnosticism? That means buyers aren\u0026rsquo;t limited to using the PART coin as a form of payment. They are able to use many currencies, including Bitcoin, among others. This provides a use-case for many different coins and gives them a fee-less and untraceable way to spend their cryptocurrencies without having to either go through a third-party or sell their coins for fiat on exchanges.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to note that, even though many coins can be used as a form of payment, all non-PART transactions are automatically converted into PART transactions by the marketplace. This is because the escrow smart-contract needs to use PART in order to operate. The PART coin is also required for the escrow mechanism to execute transactions anonymously (it uses PART\u0026rsquo;s CT and RingCT privacy protocols).\nThe integration of other coins can be achieved in two ways:\nAtomic Swaps Atomic swaps are decentralized and trustless trades between two users of different cryptocurrencies.\nThey involve each party paying into a contract transaction, one contract for each blockchain. The contracts contain an output that is spendable by either party, but the rules required for redemption are different for each party involved.\nOne party (called counterparty 1 or the initiator) generates a secret key and sends the intended trade amount into a smart-contract. The second party (called counterparty 2 or the participant) can only redeem the funds by knowing the secret key. If a pre-determined period of time (typically 48 hours) expires after the smart-contract transaction has been mined or staked and the funds have not been redeemed by the participant, the funds can be refunded back to the initiator\u0026rsquo;s wallet.\nFor simplicity, we assume the initiator wishes to trade Particl for Decred with the participant. The initiator can also trade Decred for Particl and the steps will be the same, but with each step performed on the other blockchain. At this point, the participant is unable to claim the funds from the initiator\u0026rsquo;s Particl smart-contract because the secret key is unknown by them. If the initiator revealed their secret key at this moment, the participant could claim the funds from the contract without ever honoring their end of the trade, leaving the initiator at a loss.\nTo avoid this, the participant creates a similar smart-contract but on the Decred blockchain and sends the intended Decred amount into it. However, for the initiator to redeem the output, their own secret key must be revealed to the participant. For the participant to create their smart-contract, the initiator must reveal not the secret key (since the participant could stil claim funds and not honor their end of the deal), but a cryptographic hash of the secret key to the participant so that the smart-contract can be properly deployed. The participant\u0026rsquo;s contract can equally be refunded after a pre-determined period of time.\nThe initiator then redeems the participant\u0026rsquo;s Decred funds by revealing the secret key to the participant’s smart-contract. The secret key is then extracted from the initiator\u0026rsquo;s redeeming Decred transaction providing the participant with the ability to redeem the initiator\u0026rsquo;s Particl contract.\nThis procedure is atomic (with timeout) as it gives each party a set period of time to redeem their coins on the other blockchain before a refund can be performed. This is the best option for people requiring privacy, and is also probably going to be the cheapest to use.\nThird-Party Integrations  Preview of built-in Swap app in Particl Desktop 3.0  Using the very flexible and modular Particl Desktop wallet, third-parties can easily be integrated to enhance the user experience and provide optional services. One such example is the integration of non-custodial exchanges such as SimpleSwap, StealthEx or Changelly.\nWhile not as private and cheap as atomic swaps, third-party services do offer some benefits. Liquidity and volume, at this point in time, can be much better on centralized exchanges. Some of these services (i.e. SimpleSwap, StealthEx, Changelly) also offer fiat options and pairs. This would allow the Open Marketplace to offer in-wallet fiat payment options.\nParticl will always prioritize decentralized solutions over ones that introduce third-parties. However, payment options need to have volume and liquidity for them to be efficient and cost-effective for the user.\n"});index.add({'id':79,'href':'/tutorial/wallets/particl-cli/','title':"Particl CLI",'content':"    About Particl CLI Features Getting started  Installation Backup \u0026amp; Restore   Usage  Basic commands Informative Actions  Confidential Transactions (Blind)   Wallet unlocking  With enhanced privacy Standard unlocking          Preview of Particl CLI  About Particl CLI Particl-cli offers all the essential features, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t include all the advanced bells and whistles of Particl graphical clients.\nControlled via command line interface, Particl-cli is usually used on remote machines and computers without monitors, e.g. servers and less powerful devices like Raspberry Pi (which make great dedicated staking devices!).\n Download Particl-cli   Report bugs   Also check out Partyman staking utility which is a great tool to manage your staking node with ease – it\u0026rsquo;s beginner-friendly and automates many of the tedious tasks related to maintenance of your node!

This form of storage works without relying on servers and without centralizing powers into masternodes.\nAbout DSN DSN is a generic term that describes a specific set of software with the purpose of storing and retrieving data on the internet. The usage of the term DSN is simply a layer of abstraction.\nIt is not required to know how a specific DSN works internally as long as it can store blobs of data and later retrieve them using a comparable cryptographic identifier. Popular DSNs include BitMessage, IPFS, SMSG, HTTPs, TOR etc.\nImplementation The default (and for the moment, the only) DSN used on Particl is SMSG. It is a P2P BitMessage-like message mixnet that runs parallel to Particl\u0026rsquo;s blockchain. It is hosted on the same nodes that run the Particl blockchain.\n How SMSG works  A small hash of the hosted content is created and stored on the Particl blockchain when it is used to store data on a DSN. To verify the integrity of data when the client retrieves it back from the DSN, its hash is recomputed and compared with the one stored on the Particl blockchain. The data is considered trusted if the hashes match, and rejected by the platform if they don’t.\nRead more about Data Storage Network on OMP  "});index.add({'id':83,'href':'/tutorial/merchants/','title':"Merchants",'content':"    Accepting PART for Merchants  Besides selling directly on Particl Open Marketplace, it is very easy to accept PART payments in your current shop as well     Self-hosting PART payment processor  BTCPayServer is a self-hosted, open-source cryptocurrency payment processor.

It operates parallel to Particl\u0026rsquo;s network and is hosted on the same nodes running the blockchain.\n SMSG network topology  All nodes continuously attempt to decrypt every incoming message, but can only succeed if the node is able to recalculate the HMAC hash accompanying the message. If the hash check fails, then it can not be decrypted by the node, which means the message was either fraudulent, tampered with or meant for another node.\nPrivacy benefits SMSG messages are stripped from of any metadata, therefore it is impossible for anyone to extract information such as IP addresses, sender or receiver.

The OMP is available as an open-source protocol on Particl\u0026rsquo;s Github page and is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.\nRead Open Market Protocol documentation for in-depth info.  Design The Open Market Protocol is divided into two distinct formats.\n Public listing format – contains all the necessary data related to a certain item or service listed for sale. This includes the title, description, images, payment destination, and other similar information. Private message format – contains all the data that must remain private. It includes the transaction information, the conversations between the seller and the buyer, and the buyer\u0026rsquo;s address.   The protocol has few virtues in mind: extensibility and privacy.\n Extensibility Technology moves at an exponential rate. The very few protocols that survive the test of time are all designed with extensibility in mind. A protocol looking to be relevant on a long enough timeline should be both robust and flexible enough to allow any developer to expand it. The development of both decentralized storage networks (DHTs, BitTorrent, IPFS) and blockchain solutions is still young. Since there aren\u0026rsquo;t any clear “winners” that meet all criteria, nor may there ever be, the protocol must accommodate for it.\nPrivacy Privacy is also an important cornerstone of the OMP. The protocol specifies a format for private messages that buyers and sellers must use to communicate. We strongly recommend that these messages be exchanged over end-to-end encrypted communication channels. Recent revelations and academic papers have proven beyond a doubt that there are many active threats to our digital privacy and security.\nAdditionally, blockchains are open public books that are full of sensitive information for passive attackers to abuse. This was of great concern when designing this protocol as it puts users at risk.\nPortability The online e-commerce industry is a fragmented space. A few big companies such as Amazon and eBay have established a dominant position in the market. A tremendous amount of small online stores are also not to be neglected. There are a plethora of software applications to set up online shops, but almost none of them are designed for interoperability.\nOne of the frustrations online merchants suffer is the lack of portability of their inventory data between different online marketplaces. The more markets products are available on, the greater their exposure and thus, the greater their potential revenue streams. Yet, importing the inventory data into another application or website remains a cumbersome process. This is often done on purpose to prevent vendors from using competing platforms. Up until now, vendors are limited to either importing CSV files (which have many limitations) or using third-party software that manages many marketplaces.\nThe lack of inventory portability by large enterprises is deliberate. It is a strategy to prevent vendors from offering their goods on competing platforms. Moving large amounts of inventory data to a competitor is a painstaking process that restricts vendor\u0026rsquo;s economic potential.\nThe OMP allows for full inventory data portability, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop there. It also lets vendors easily assign images as well as payment and shipping details to specific listings. Transferring data to other marketplaces that follow the OMP specification becomes very straightforward.\nThe current rise of blockchain technology has given programmers a toolset to interact with money in a way that wasn\u0026rsquo;t possible before. The OMP payment formats operate with the Bitcoin blockchain and any derivatives. It also allows merchants to accept a multitude of virtual currencies on a per item basis.\nA unified protocol is a step in the right direction. It fosters a more open and free e-commerce experience where portability, not fragmentation, is glorified.\n"});index.add({'id':87,'href':'/learn/misc/','title':"Misc.",'content':"    Proposals  Community initiatives to advance the Particl ecosystem     Particl Foundation  Particl Foundation is a non-profit organisation, serving the Particl ecosystem and promoting awareness of financial privacy     "});index.add({'id':88,'href':'/tags/API/','title':"API",'content':""});index.add({'id':89,'href':'/tags/atomic-swaps/','title':"atomic swaps",'content':""});index.add({'id':90,'href':'/tags/bitcoin/','title':"bitcoin",'content':""});index.add({'id':91,'href':'/tags/blockchain/','title':"blockchain",'content':""});index.add({'id':92,'href':'/tags/bulletproofs/','title':"bulletproofs",'content':""});index.add({'id':93,'href':'/tags/coin-control/','title':"coin control",'content':""});index.add({'id':94,'href':'/tags/community/','title':"community",'content':""});index.add({'id':95,'href':'/tags/Contribute/','title':"Contribute",'content':""});index.add({'id':96,'href':'/contribute/','title':"Contribute to Wiki",'content':"    List of incomplete articles How to contribute  Editing/creating pages   Useful Shortcodes  Table of Contents Buttons Images and video YouTube / Vimeo Icons Labels Hints Columns Tabs       List of incomplete articles Articles tagged with \u0026ldquo;TODO\u0026rdquo; are either completely missing or just unfinished.
